# Antarctic Adventure [Remake]
Cute penquin... Yeah, that's it. he's too cute.

This project is one of my university assignments. It's based from topic that I had to remake a game (older than play station 2) contain of 10 levels and it could be played on mobile with screen controller

I haven't published the mobile version yet. (tested on low-end mobile but the polygons in there are far too high)
