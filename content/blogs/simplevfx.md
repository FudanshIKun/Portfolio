# Simple Shaders & Visual Effects
This project is one of my university assignments. It's based from my university assignment (CGE499-Visual Effect for Game)  Shader and Visual Effect for game. 
Mostly used Shadergraph in UnityEngine, but some of them in here used ShaderLab for development instead.

This one has no published application or build. Only the source code, you can visited in my journey Page

# Overview
In This repository, Contain Shaders & Visual Effects (Using ShaderLab, ShaderGraph, Particle System and Visual Effect Graph in UnityEngine) Mostly are related to the assignment, some may not.

---

# Project Scope
This project was scoped from CGE499-Visual Effect for Game. Which provided me a lot of knowledge about Shader and Effect in game.

---

# What I learned
- Shadergraph usages to make simple surface shader and post process.
- Particle System Usages in UnityEngine and Games
- Visual Effect Graph compared to Particle System
- Surfaces Shader and Simple Shader logics using ShaderGraph
- Post Processing Shader in URP Render Pipeline
