# Simple Otome Game
I tried it, It wasn't very much fun game. But I had more time, I would remake it lol.

This project is one of my university assignments. This one based from my university subject (CGE108-2D Game Development) I was interested in this genre. And my idea was to create a game that you can develop a romantic relationship with anyone in my major (It was fun ideas)

If you choose the rright answer in conversation with them, You get +1 relation point. Which can be saved in your devices for the next times you opened the game and will be reset after you start a new game.
