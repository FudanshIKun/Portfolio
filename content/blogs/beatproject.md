# BEATPROJECT
A Game where injustice becomes law, so you do crime and save the day.

This project once was my university assignment and I designed to continued it. So, it's still currently under development in the background. I don't plan to release my university assignment - version, since I don't think, I've pushed enough to confidently published it yet. 

You can viewed the trailer of the game (university assignment) in the highlight of my Welcome page.
