# Simple Third Person Arrow Shooting Game
This was very fun project for me, But I didn't really looking to improve graphic quality, I worked alone on entirely project so I Made it more like a prototype.

This project is one of my university assignments. Based from my university subject (CGE109-3D Game Development) 

The desktop version can be downloaded from my Journey Page

# Overview
In this game, You'll started right in the field full of turret which'll shoot at you if you get in their range (but they doesn't kill you tho) In return, you can shoot them as well. Using the bow, you're holding. Press right side of the screen to start charging. Drag left and right to aim. Release at the right time of the aim indication, which'll show up after you start charging (if there're target you can aim at around) if you release at the right time, the arrow'll hit. If you make perfect timing (release at exactly half charging) you'll make more damage (but every turret die after one shot) else'll make you miss the shot entirely.

It was inspirationed by a game named "Pathless".
